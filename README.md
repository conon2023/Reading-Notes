# GROWTH MINDSET   
## What is a Growth Mindset?
This is a basic belief that one's inate abilities can be stretched further through hardwork and consistent effort and rooted in a concept of constant and never ending improvement.  

## Three (3) Reasons to Keep in Mind for a Consistent Growth Mindset
1. Consisten effort towards a goal will pay better dividend than talent and abilites.
2. Taking a short break when it seems all overwhelming and coming back later on have been known to help.
3. Consult those knowledgeable in the field when all else fails.
